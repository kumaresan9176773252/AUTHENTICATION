MERN Stack Authentication Project
Overview
This project is a full-stack authentication system built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and access protected routes.

Features
User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
JWT Authentication: Implemented JWT to manage authentication tokens, ensuring secure access to protected routes.
Password Hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.
Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles with varying levels of access.
Protected Routes: Backend API routes are protected and accessible only to authenticated users.
Responsive Design: The front-end is built using React and is fully responsive.
Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js: For building the user interface.
React Router: For client-side routing.
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend API.
Material-UI: For responsive and customizable UI components.
Backend
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js, used to create the backend API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user information.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB, used to interact with the database.
JWT (JSON Web Token): For securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
Bcrypt.js: For hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.
Usage
Register: Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password to receive a JWT token.
Access Protected Routes: Users can access protected routes in the application using the JWT token.
Future Improvements
Implement social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Add email verification during registration.
Implement password reset functionality.
